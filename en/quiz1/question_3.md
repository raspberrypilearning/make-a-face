legend: Question 3 of 3
---

Eli was commissioned to design a face to be used on a t-shirt. Eli wrote code using variables for all the different positions, sizes, and colours in their design.

The company loved it! They have asked Eli to create lots more similar designs. 

Why did making the design with code make it quicker for Eli to make lots of new designs?

--- choices ---

- ( ) Coding is fun.

  --- feedback ---

True, but that's not why it made it quicker for Eli to produce lots of new designs.
 
  --- /feedback ---

- (x) It's easy to change the numbers stored in variables to make lots of new designs.

  --- feedback ---

Correct! Eli was able to quickly make lots of slightly different versions of their design by changing the numbers stored in the variables. 

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) The code runs really quickly.

  --- feedback ---

True, but that doesn't help to create lots of different designs.
  
  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Variables always have different numbers every time you run your program.

  --- feedback ---

Not quite. Variables have the value you assign to them. If you assign a number to a variable (such as `eye_radius = 50`) and don't change it then it will be the same every time you run the program.
