In your project, you added code to draw a face with many features. The order of your code was extremely important to make the face look like your design. 

If you ran this code, what would the face look like?

def draw():

  #Face
  stroke(0) #Black
  fill(255) #White
  ellipse(200, 200, 200, 190)
  no_stroke()
  
  #Eyes
  fill(0, 255, 0) #Green
  ellipse(160, 180, 60, 60)
  ellipse(240, 180, 60, 60)
  fill(0) #Black
  ellipse(160, 180, 30, 30)
  ellipse(240, 180, 30, 30)

 Not quite, look at the order of the `ellipse()` and the `stroke()` functions.

 Correct, the code draws a face with a black stroke then turns off the stroke before drawing the circles. The green circles are drawn first with the black circles on top of them.
