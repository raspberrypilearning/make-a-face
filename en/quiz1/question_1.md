def draw():
  fill(0, 0, 0) #Black
  ellipse(160, 200, 150, 150)
  fill(255, 255, 255) #White
  ellipse(160, 150, 150, 150)

  Not quite, to create a sad mouth the second `ellipse` would need a **y_coordinate** that is lower than the first `ellipse`.

  That's correct! The second `ellipse` is drawn with a **y_coordinate** that is higher than the first `ellipse`.

   Not quite, the second circle has a white `fill(255, 255, 255)` and is positioned partially over the first black circle.

The code does not draw rectangles. The `ellipse` function draws circles.
