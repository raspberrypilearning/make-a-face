## Add a mouth

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
A mouth is a great way of showing emotion. Will your character have a smile, frown, or something else?

Think about what kind of mouth your face needs. The simplest mouth would be a circle to look surprised. 

You could add two overlapping circles to create a smile or frown. Triangles or rectangles could be added for teeth.

Add code to your `draw()` function to add a mouth.

title: Create a mouth from overlapping circles
---

Set the `fill` colour for your mouth then draw an `ellipse`. Set the `fill` colour again, this time to match the face colour, then draw a second `ellipse`.

Change the `y` coordinate of the second `ellipse` to a slightly higher position for a smile or a slightly lower position for a frown.

title: Create a mouth using rectangles
---

Robots are often shown with `rectangle` shaped mouths. Sometimes `rectangle` and `ellipse` shapes are used together to create a grimace emoji or to add a face mask. 

![The output area showing a face with rectangle facemask.](images/rectangle-mask.png)

Add the code for a `rectangle`, then create a smaller `rectangle` within it. Change the `stroke` and `fill` colours to complement your theme. Add `ellipse` shapes if needed. 

**Tip:** Remember to put the `ellipse` shapes above the `rectangle` code if you want them to go behind the `rectangle` shapes. 

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw()
---
    # Face mask
    no_fill()
    stroke(255, 255, 255)
    ellipse(150, 250, 30, 30)  # Left ear loop
    ellipse(250, 250, 30, 30)  # Right ear loop
    fill(255, 255, 255)
    no_stroke()
    rect(150, 230, 100, 40)  # Large white rectangle
    fill(108, 200, 206)
    rect(152, 235, 96, 30)  # Smaller blue rectangle

**Tip:** Add a `#Mouth` comment on the line before your mouth code to help you easily find the mouth code.

**Choose:** You could also add multiple teeth to your mouth using `translate` to change the `x` coordinate after each tooth is drawn. 

--- collapse ---

---
title: Use a loop to add a row of teeth
---

Add code to create a `for` loop that repeats in order to create the number of teeth you need. 

![The output area showing a robot face with a row of rectangle teeth in different colours.](images/robot-teeth.png)

After each tooth has been drawn, add code to `translate()` it by the width of the tooth. 

You can also add code to change the colour of each tooth.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw()
---

    # Mouth
    fill(90, 110, 184)
    red = 90  # Starting amount of red
    green = 110  # Starting amount of green
    blue = 180  # Starting amount of blue
    for i in range (0,6):
        rect(100, 300, 33, 50)
        fill(red, green, blue)  # Uses variables to control the colour change each loop
        red = red+40
        blue = blue-30
        translate(33, 0)  # Move along the x coordinate by the width of a tooth

title: Use triangles to add fangs
---

Create a `rectangle` to use as the line of the mouth.

Add two `triangle` shapes to create the fangs. Change the `x` coordinates for each corner to position the fangs at opposite ends of the mouth line.

    # Mouth

    rect(170, 260, 60, 5)  # Mouth line
    fill(0)
    triangle(170, 260, 180, 280, 190, 260)  # Left tooth
    triangle(210, 260, 220, 280, 230, 260)  # Right tooth

**Debug:** You might find some bugs in your project that you need to fix. Here are some common bugs.

---
title: My overlapping shape goes outside the face
---

If you use two overlapping shapes to create a mouth, then you need to make sure the shape that is the same colour as the face doesn't go outside the face. If it does, then change the width or height of the shape so that it's small enough to fit inside the face.

title: I have too many teeth
---

Don't forget that `range()` creates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 not 1. This may make a difference to your code depending on how you have positioned your teeth.
