## Upgrade your project

If you have time you can upgrade to your project. 

Each example in this project is saved to our [Make a Face Examples library](https://trinket.io/library/folder/make-a-face-examples){:target="_blank"} open the projects in Trinket and look at the code to get ideas and see how they work.

Here are some other ideas you could try:
- Add interactivity - try our **Interactive: Theatre Mask**, what happens when you move your mouse across the screen?  
- Add animation - try our **Animated: Frida** , what happens to Frida's headband when you run the project? 

**Interactive: Theatre Mask**: [See inside](https://trinket.io/python/86d89fad13){:target="_blank"}
