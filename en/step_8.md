## Upgrade your project

If you have time you can upgrade to your project. 

Each of the examples in the [Introduction](.) was created in Trinket and you can look at the code to get ideas and see how they work.

Here are some other ideas you could try:
- Add interactivity — try our **Interactive: Theatre Mask**, what happens when you move your mouse across the screen?  
- Add animation — try our **Animated: Frida**, what happens to Frida's headband when you run the project?
