## Choose a theme

<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Have you got an idea about the kind of face or mask you want to make? Use this step to plan your art and set up your canvas.

Open the [starter project](https://editor.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/make-face-starter){:target="_blank"}. The Raspberry Pi code editor will open in another browser tab.

**Choose:** Think about the kind of face you want to make: 
+ Do you want to choose something from your heritage or popular culture? 
+ Will your art show a human, animal, something mythical, or perhaps a machine? 
+ You might even want to create a self-portrait!
+ You could draw an emoji to share with your friends

The first thing to do when creating art using the Python `Processing library` is to add `def setup():` to define a `setup` function that is run once at the beginning of your program.

The starter project has a `setup` function that sets the `size` of your canvas to `400` width and `400` height. 

**Choose:** Experiment with the numbers and run your code to find a size that you are happy with.

def setup():   
    size(400, 400)  # 400 by 400 works well for a round face

**Choose:** Think about the colours you will use for your face and change the `background` colour values to set your screen to a complementary colour.

    background(255, 255, 255)  # Try different numbers to change the colour

**Tip:** The `draw` function has `grid()` code. This adds a coordinates grid over your background that helps you work out where to position features on your face. 

To turn the grid off add a `#` in front of the code, to turn it back on remove the `#`.

language: python
filename: main.py - draw()

    grid()  # Shows grid

    #grid()  # Hide grid by turning it into a comment

**Test:** Run your project to see your chosen screen size and background colour.

**Debug:** You might find some bugs in your project that you need to fix. Here are some common bugs.

After changing the code, you will need to **`Run`** your project to see the changes in the output area.

The maximum amount of red, green, or blue is `255`. Make sure all your `background` colour values are between `0` and `255`.
